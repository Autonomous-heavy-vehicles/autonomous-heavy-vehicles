        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            Perception and Navigation for Autonomous Heavy Machines in Shared Environments
        </p>
        <p>

            Automation is rapidly advancing in off-road industries, creating an urgent need for research on autonomy 
            in unstructured and dynamic environments. Autonomous heavy vehicles --- such as trucks, excavators, and 
            loaders --- are transforming construction, mining, and logistics by improving safety, efficiency, 
            and reliability. However, deploying these systems presents three major challenges: 
            perception in harsh environments, navigation across unstructured terrains, and human-vehicle collaboration in shared workspaces.
            Perception systems struggle to detect and classify obstacles in harsh conditions such as fog and uneven lighting. 
            Navigation and motion planning must address difficulties in planning safe and efficient trajectories on slippery, 
            muddy, or uneven terrains, while considering vehicles size, weight, and limited maneuverability. 
            As autonomous systems are often deployed alongside human-driven machines and in human-populated environments, 
            human-vehicle collaboration in shared workspaces poses additional safety and efficiency challenges. 
        </p>
        <p>
           
        </p>
        <p>
            This workshop will bring together robotics researchers and industry experts to address
            these challenges, with a focus on reliable perception, adaptive motion planning, and
            human-aware autonomy. Unlike previous workshops that have primarily focused on ur-
            ban driving, structured industrial settings, or general field robotics, this event will specif-
            ically target the challenges of autonomous off-road heavy vehicle in highly un-
            structured and shared environments.

            This workshop aligns closely with IROS 2025s mission to advance cutting-edge
            robotics research and expand the focus on autonomous heavy vehicles — an un-
            derrepresented yet high-impact robotics domain. By integrating perspectives from
            academia and industry, this event will contribute to shaping future research direc-
            tions and provide collaborative opportunities to accelerate the real-world deployment
            of autonomous heavy vehicles.

                        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>"Planning and control of mobile machinery in unstructured and dynamic 
                            environments is a difficult problem regardless of the level of automation. Machines used for construction, mining 
                            and forestry have the task of physically manipulating the environment in various ways according to a well-defined goal, 
                            e.g., transforming the terrain to a new state; loading, transporting, and, off-loading objects of a certain kind; or 
                            subdividing or merging materials into new structures. This should be executed with a certain error tolerance, minimal 
                            use of time and energy, and without causing damage to the environment. To succeed in this, it is important to have good 
                            information about the surrounding environment, e.g., in the form of a semantic 3D map including information physical 
                            properties of objects and materials. In general, many vehicles operate simultaneously in these environments. 
                            This is a complicating factor but also offers opportunities. A machine can benefit from observations generated 
                            from another machine's interaction with the environment. A machine can improve, or worsen, the conditions for 
                            another machine to perform its tasks. We therefore develop solutions to estimate physical states and properties 
                            of materials and objects in the environment of mobile equipment. The world state is represented as a 3D scene 
                            with object and material properties that supports both physics-based forward simulation, motion planning using 
                            inverse dynamics or a learned world model, and generation of synthetic sensor data for model inference. We use 
                            OpenPLX for representing these world states in an interoperable format. Demonstrations include examples from 
                            forestry and earthmoving operations involving handling of logs, rocks, and deformable terrain.

                        <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>"To achieve robust off-road navigation, there's an increasing demand for learning-based approaches capable of
                            generalizing beyond trained situations. However, the dynamic and highly unstructured characteristics of off-road
                            environments invariably result in distribution shifts, which can lead to unreliable outputs from learned models.
                            This talk will introduce key methodologies designed to address the distribution shift challenge in robust off-road navigation.
                            Specifically, we will explore how robust perception and planning can be effectively combined with learning-based adaptation
                            in unstructured environments.

                            <p class="abstract"><strong>Abstract:</strong>"No research algorithm or concept fully survives contact with the "real world", 
                                and this has been our experience in a number of projects translating world class fundamental research in 
                                perception and localization into deployable technology on autonomous vehicles, both on- and off-road. 
                                A flagship example of this has been our work in localization for underground mining vehicles, which, 
                                along with other projects in on-road autonomous vehicles, have provided many valuable insights that 
                                are worth sharing and discussing with the research community. These insights include: the limitations 
                                of "gold standard" performance metrics for localization and perception in predicting a technique's real-world 
                                utility; the underappreciated role of introspection - systems that "know when they don't know"; 
                                and the need for a much more sophisticated and nuanced understanding of errors and their highly 
                                variable significance across space, time and task. I'll illustrate these key concepts using 
                                concrete examples from our industry projects in these areas, and propose some paths forward 
                                for the research sector that will better link what is rewarded and celebrated in the research 
                                community with its likely eventual utility in deployed robots and systems."</p>

                            mining, search and rescue, exploration, and defense. While off-road has many similarities to 
                            urban areas, a major difference is the lack of an obstacle/no obstacle dichotomy. That is, 
                            in off-road scenarios, not all objects are obstacles, and identifying which objects are 
                            traversable in a reliable way is critical. Our research covers a wide range of topics that 
                            aim at expanding the robot’s capability as well as improving its robustness in challenging 
                            environments. We utilize modern machine learning techniques while eliminating the exhausting 
                            hand-labeling process. Specifically, we explore self-supervised learning and learning-from-demonstration 
                            to understand the terrain traversability cost and vehicle dynamics from large-scale interaction data, 
                            and online adapt the cost and dynamics model to overcome the out-of-distribution failures. Our system doesn’t 
                            require human-labeled data. Instead, it relies on its own experiences of interacting with the environment, 
                            while being aware of the uncertainty in each model, and online adapts the model in novel situations. "</p>
